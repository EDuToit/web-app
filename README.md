## Retro Rabbit Golf Course Mapper

### Project overview
The goal of the project is to allow golf course owners/managers to draw the shape of their
courses using a web application. Details such as the location of the hole and any natural
hazards can also be included in the map of the course.

Players on the course should then be able to use a mobile application to see the map of the
course and where they are on it currently. This will allow the players to plan their shots more
strategically.
